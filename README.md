## LaTex Project 
Final project for my Desktop Publishing class. I wrote a Documentation with LaTex and explained how and why  it is way more helpful to use LaTex for any equation or chemical reaction based Documentation.

* You can view the `pdf` file to see the output of my sourcecode file
* You will find the `sourcecode` in .tex file
